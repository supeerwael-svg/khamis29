# EduTrack — RLS policies, helper functions, and RPCs

Adds Row Level Security to every table with institution-scoped access.
Admins see all rows in their institution; supervisors see only their assigned classes.
Also creates join-request RPCs used by the auth flow.

1. Helper Functions:
   - is_inst_member(uid, inst_id): checks if a user belongs to an institution
   - can_access_class(uid, cls_id): checks if a user can access a class (admin or assigned supervisor)

2. RLS Policies (per table):
   - institutions: members can SELECT, any authenticated can INSERT (signup), admin can UPDATE
   - profiles: self or institution members can SELECT, self can INSERT, self or admin can UPDATE
   - memberships: self or admin can SELECT, self can INSERT, admin can UPDATE/DELETE
   - join_requests: applicant or admin can SELECT, self can INSERT, admin can UPDATE
   - classes: institution members can SELECT, admin can INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
   - class_assignments: self or admin can SELECT, admin can INSERT/DELETE
   - students: class-access users can SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
   - lessons: class-access users can SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
   - attendance_records: class-access users can SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
   - teacher_absences: institution members can SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE, admin can DELETE
   - absence_episodes: class-access users can SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
   - teachers: institution members can SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE, admin can DELETE
   - teacher_class_assignments: institution members can full CRUD
   - teacher_lesson_assignments: institution members can full CRUD
   - institution_settings: members can SELECT, admin can INSERT/UPDATE
   - audit_events: members can SELECT, any authenticated can INSERT
   - developer_info: members can SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE, admin can DELETE
   - pending_sync_operations: self only (SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)

3. RPCs (SECURITY DEFINER):
   - submit_join_request: validates joining code + expiry, creates pending request
   - get_own_join_request_status: returns current user's latest join request status

4. Trigger:
   - on_auth_user_created: auto-creates profile row on signup
